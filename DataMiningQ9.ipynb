K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation</h2>\n","\n","<h3>How it works:</h3>\n","<p><strong>KNN imputation</strong> fills in missing data by using the values of \"neighbors,\" which are the data points that are most similar to the missing point.</p>\n","<p>The \"similarity\" between data points is typically measured using <strong>Euclidean distance</strong> or other distance metrics.</p>\n","<p>For each missing value, the algorithm identifies the <strong>K nearest neighbors</strong> (based on the available data points) and imputes the missing value as the <strong>average (or weighted average)</strong> of those neighbors' values.</p>\n","\n","<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>\n","If you are missing data for 2020, KNN would look at the values for 2019 and 2021 and impute 2020 as the average of these two values.</p>\n","\n","<h3>Advantages:</h3>\n","<ul>\n","  <li><strong>Takes relationships into account</strong>: KNN finds and uses the most similar data points, reflecting the underlying data structure more accurately than simpler methods like mean imputation.</li>\n","  <li><strong>Works well with small datasets</strong>: Particularly useful when the missing data is sparse and neighboring points provide valuable information.</li>\n","</ul>\n","\n","<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>\n","<ul>\n","  <li><strong>Computationally expensive</strong>: Identifying the nearest neighbors can be slow, especially with large datasets.</li>\n","  <li><strong>Sensitive to irrelevant features</strong>: If irrelevant features are present, KNN may incorrectly identify neighbors.</li>\n","  <li><strong>Struggles with sparse data</strong>: If the dataset is sparse, it may not find good neighbors to make accurate predictions.</li>\n","</ul>\n","\n","---\n","\n","<h2>2.
